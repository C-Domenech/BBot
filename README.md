# BBot

That is a bot made using Selenium and Python. I created it as part of my practice with Selenium and web scraping. In these script, there are four defined parts:

1. Time module that control the starting and ending moment for the bot action.
2. Webdriver set up with microphone and camera options.
3. Control of a modern website with side panels that need to be open.
4. Interaction with a chat: get message content and react with it.
